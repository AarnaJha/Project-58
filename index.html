      <p>ðŸ™‚ I love to swim . There is a swimming pool in the Club in my society  . My father is a member of that Club. He goes there to swim during weekends. So I also learned swimming during my summer holidays. In the beginning, I was a bit afraid to learn swimming but I love to play in the water. My father taught me swimming during weekends.He taught me the leg and hand strokes and breath control. He also taught me many types of swimming like butterfly swimming , etc .ðŸŒŸ  Then I got the strokes and I have mastered breath control easily.ðŸ™‚</p>
